# Personal_Codeforces_Trainer
This repository contains the script to suggest problems based on provided ratings. The questions will be chosen such that the person has not solved it previously, done with the help of the official Codeforces API. This only generates unsolved problems for one user, i.e., it is not supported for a list of people.

## Directions of use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the command line and run this script, `python app.py`.
3. Input your username, number of questions and rating of each problem (seperated by spaces).
4. Copy the question code and paste that in the slot for creating your own mashups on codeforces.
